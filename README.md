# Tough Place To Go

Football pundits frequently say that the team that is bottom of their respective league is a "tough place to go",
despite all evidence pointing to it being the easiest away game of the season. For some reason this phrase has always 
struck a chord with me, and it has therefore become the name of the home of my football analyses.

WIP:
- League Tables always lie. Adding more context to football league tables to give an indication of whether we can trust
it yet.
